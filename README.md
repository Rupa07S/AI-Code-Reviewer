AI Chatbot with Gemini and Streamlit: README
This project uses the Gemini large language model with the Streamlit framework to create an interactive AI chatbot application.

Features:

User-friendly chat interface: Streamlit provides a chat-like interface for users to interact with the AI chatbot seamlessly.
Gemini integration: Leverages the powerful Gemini-1.5-pro-latest model for generating responses to user prompts.
Contextual conversation: The chatbot maintains conversation history, allowing it to understand the context and respond more accurately.
Error handling: The code includes exception handling to gracefully handle API errors or other issues.
Requirements:

Python 3.7+
Streamlit
google-generativeai
A Gemini API key (replace "Geminiapi_key" placeholder with your actual key)
Installation:

Clone this repository or download the code.
Install the required libraries: pip install streamlit google-generativeai
Set your Gemini API key in the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY.
Usage:

Run the application: streamlit run your_script_name.py
Start chatting with the AI in the Streamlit interface.
Code Overview:

generate_response(user_prompt): This function sends the user's prompt to the Gemini model and returns the generated response.
main(): Sets up the Streamlit interface, handles user input, displays the conversation history, and calls generate_response to get AI responses.
Customization:

System instructions: Modify the system_instruction parameter in the GenerativeModel constructor to change the AI's persona and behavior.
Model version: Explore different Gemini model versions available in the GenerativeModel constructor for varied response styles and capabilities.
Additional Notes:

Ensure you have a valid Gemini API key and sufficient quota to use the model.
This code provides a basic framework. Extend it with features like user authentication, different chatbots, or more complex conversation flows.
